# Validator-Conversion

Validator-Conversion service (VACO) handles its namesake tasks for the common transit standards such as 
[GTFS][gtfs] and [NeTEx Nordic profile][netex-nordic]. The functionality is exposed through a simple Queue API where
each VACO task is processed asynchronously and the results are fetched using the Queue API's ticket abstraction.
